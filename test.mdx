We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

```sql
UPDATE AWBuilderVersion
set ModifiedDate = GETDATE(),
    [Database Version] = 'nova verzija'
go


alter table NYCTaxi_Sample
add ID_new int identity (1,1) not null

create view DimTarife as 
select ROW_NUMBER() over (order by rate_code asc) as TarifaID, rate_code as BrojTarife
from
(select distinct rate_code from dbo.nyctaxi_sample) as rate_code

create view DimOperater as 
select ROW_NUMBER() over (order by vendor_id asc) as OperaterID, vendor_id as NazivOperatera
from
(select distinct vendor_id from dbo.nyctaxi_sample) as vendor_id

create view FactVoznja as 
select 
ID_new as VoznjaID,
pickup_datetime as DatumPocetka,
pickup_longitude as GeoSirPocetka,
pickup_latitude as GeoDuzPocetka,
DimTarife.TarifaID,
DimOperater.OperaterID
from
dbo.nyctaxi_sample inner join DimTarife 
on dbo.nyctaxi_sample.rate_code=DimTarife.BrojTarife
inner join DimOperater
on dbo.nyctaxi_sample.vendor_id=DimOperater.NazivOperatera

```

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
